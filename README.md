A personal website written by Peter McNeil. Using Jekyll as the static generator
 with S3 as hosting.

CSS/HTML/JS are all painstakingly written by myself through self-teaching.

#### Scripts
`aws-update` is a script that will upload the statically generated website to S3 and 
invalidate cloudfront with a flag `-i`. Needs cleaning up.
