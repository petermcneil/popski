Drop aims to aid the cause to spend more time outdoors, giving users a reason to head out and explore by providing a platform to share content about highly 
localised areas. Drop achieves this by giving users options to “drop” a message in the world and other users can find these drops by exploring outdoors, incentivising exploration.

Discovery of messages is envisaged as a random act. A user would be moving around the world and receive notifications that a Drop is available. They would then be able to view and collect the Drop in their collection, “Collected Drops”.
Additional methods of discovery can be added as an extension to the product. 
For example, a user could ask for Drop to give them a random Drop within a given radius. 
Drop would then assign one and show a hot/cold radar for the user to follow until the Drop has been found. 
This method of discovery would hopefully drive people to explore their surrounding neighbourhoods.
