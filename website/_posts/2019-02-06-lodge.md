Traditionally video and subtitle files have been separated; requiring distributing many files to play a video with subtitles or for the video editor to burn the subtitles into the video frame. This project, Lodge, aims to fix this by using steganography in a novel way to hide the subtitles inside individual video frames.


Lodge will consist of two software products for dealing with subtitling in videos. One program (Lodge Encoder) will be used by video editors or stenographers and will merge the subtitles into the video file. The other program (Lodge Viewer) will be used by the layperson while watching videos and will extract the subtitles from the video file and display them to the user. The two products to-gether will provide a complete end-to-end workflow for subtitling. 


In addition to the Encoder and Viewer, Lodge will deliver a data format specifi-cation. This specification will detail how the subtitles are merged with the video files, with the hope that other implementations could be made from the open source specification.


Simply put the goal of this project is to combine subtitles and video into the same file, without being burned into the video itself.
